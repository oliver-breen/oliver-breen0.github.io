                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>With over 9 years of experience in transportation and aviation, I've developed a strong foundation in operational awareness, risk management, and attention to detail—skills that translate seamlessly into cybersecurity.</p>
                
                <p>Currently, I'm completing my Bachelor's Degree of Science in Cybersecurity from Colorado State University - Global Campus. This academic journey, combined with hands-on practice through platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox, has solidified my passion for information security.</p>

                <h2>Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
                <p>The decision to transition into cybersecurity came from a natural intersection of my interests:</p>
                <ul>
